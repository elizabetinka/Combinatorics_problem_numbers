# Combinatorics_problem_numbers
Find the number of different 5-digit numbers using digits 1–9 under the given constraints. For
each case, provide examples of numbers that comply and do not comply with the constraints,
and derive a generic formula that can be applied to other values of n (total available digits) and k
(number of digits in the number). 

(e) Digits can be repeated and the number must be divisible by 3 or 5.
